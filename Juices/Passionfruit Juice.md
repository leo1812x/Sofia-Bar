## Method
1. If using fresh fruit: Cut passionfruit in half and scoop out pulp
2. Strain pulp through fine mesh to remove seeds (optional - seeds can be kept for texture)
3. If using puree: Ensure it's 100% passionfruit with no added sugars
4. Store in clean, labeled container
5. Refrigerate immediately

## Storage
- Refrigerated

## Notes
