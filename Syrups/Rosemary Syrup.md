# Rosemary Syrup

## Ingredients
- 1 quart simple syrup
- 6-8 fresh rosemary sprigs (about 1/2 cup leaves)

## Method
1. Gently bruise rosemary sprigs to release oils
2. Bring simple syrup to a gentle simmer
3. Add rosemary sprigs
4. Steep for 45 minutes off heat (longer than mint due to woody herb)
5. Strain through fine mesh, pressing herbs to extract flavor
6. Let cool completely before storing

## Storage
- Refrigerated
- Shelf life: 21 days (longer than other herb syrups)
- Store in appropriate container, label with name and date
- Keep tightly sealed

## Used In
- Gin-based cocktails
- Whiskey cocktails
- Savory cocktail variations
- Winter/fall seasonal drinks
- Herb-forward cocktails

## Notes
- Fresh rosemary essential - dried doesn't work well
- Longer steeping time needed than other herbs
- Pairs excellently with gin, whiskey, and vodka
- Can be used in savory applications beyond cocktails
- Prep when stock is low, never run out completely
